# Hi, I'm radenIsyhad - A Curious Builder, Enthusiast, and Hoshiyomi ☄️

I'm a D4 Electroincs Engineering student at POLBAN, passionate about making technology accesible, meanigful, and full of soul. I believe engineering is not about machines--It's about **people**, **curiousity**, and **solving real problems**.

## My core interests are:
- Embedded systems & robotics (especially in agriculture & education)
- Project-based learing (PBL) as a revolution in technical education
- Linux, open-source, and creative computing

I've been diving into tech since high school - tinkering with Linux, building websites, and even making a line-quiz board using just paper, light bulb, and a little logic.

### A bit more personal:
- I'm a Hoshiyomi, but also a critical thinker with soft spot for realism.
- I'm driven by the dream of sparking an **Abbasid 2.0**. a new golden age through electronics, education, and shared curiousity.
- I reflect deeply, lead calmly, and love meaningful conversations--especially when it helps someone grows.

**"Humans are like stars--sometimes they shine bright, sometimes they dim. And that's okay"**
